# dmn-audiogram (ðŸ”Š -> ðŸŽ¥)

Audiogram is a library for generating shareable videos from audio clips.

## What's in here

This is our fork of New York Public Radio's audiogram tool, with our tweaks to add some custom styles and get it running on Heroku. See [the original repo](https://github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram) for requirements, information about theme creation, etc.
